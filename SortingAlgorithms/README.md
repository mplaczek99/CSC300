# SortingAlgorithms
Sorting algorithms range from simple to intricate, and provide an excellent range of examples of problem-solving.  This exercise will come in three phases.  In the first phase we will build a few of the simplest sorting algorithms.  In the second phase we will tackle a few more complex algorithms.  The final phase is completing algorithmic analysis and timing tests.

•	Bubble Sort (5 Points)

•	Insertion Sort (10 Points)

•	Selection Sort (10 Points)

•	Shell Sort (15 Points)

•	Merge Sort (20 Points)

•	Heap Sort* (10 Points)

•	Quick Sort (20 Points)


*(You can use the existing Java heap (PriorityQueue) for 10 points, or build your own heap for 20 points)
